<p>Over spring break of 2016, I started looking at Unity player for designing video games. When I was younger I had to give up gaming on account of it turning into a bit of an addiction. But playing around in Unity respawned my interest in the gaming world. As it turns out, making games is even more addictive than playing them. What I didn't realize was how much man power it took to create a sinlge level of a game. So this is a quick cube runner game I had started one weekend. Haven't had a chance to build it out much but I would like to deploy to a mobile device</p>
