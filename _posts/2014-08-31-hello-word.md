<p>Sophmore year of college was my first exposure to a higher level coding language, classes, object and event based programming, and libraries. All of these things culminated in the end of the fall semester when some friends and I designed a Mario Themed Minesweeper using a GUI based library called FLTK and C++. Like classic minesweeper, the player has to uncover every block that is not a mine to win the game. The user has the choice to select level difficulty as well as flags, question marks, cheat mode and a game reset. To impplement the mario theme that gives this rudimentary project a little extra spice, we borrowed a few mario themed images to put in place of our cells. Initially blocks start as mario blocks, they can be right clicked to show the mario flag or a question mark box. If I mine is uncovered, bowser is revealed.</p>
