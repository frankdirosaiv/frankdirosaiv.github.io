<p>Using an infrared emitter and detector diode, a few inverting op-amps, an analog to digital converter and a few logic gates, I was able to design and effectivley implement a rudimentary security system. If the gap between the emitting and detectingn diodes was disrupted, a signal was sent through an amplifier and converter so that a consistent digital signal could be sent to a resulting green or red. </p>
