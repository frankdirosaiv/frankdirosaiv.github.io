<p>Learning to work with backend databses is not terribly complex, but to gain a deeper understanding of how SQL or MongoDB works under the covers, I built my own Database which parses its own syntax. To test this dll an application was built using Yelp data. The Database was able to successfully parse requests handling tens of thousands of entries. </p>
