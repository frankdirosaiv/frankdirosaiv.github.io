<p>I made a Client Tracker Database system for a local CPA firm. Using Microsoft Access, I was able to create an easy to use database for managing different clients, including individuals and companies. Clients were able to be filtered by ID number, name, due date, service type, and current status, which allowed for a more efficient tax season</p>
