<p>Currently, I've doing research under Dr. Tracy Hammond in the sketch recognition lab. One the projects I've been working on is called KANE. This is a project in which we use an Arduino Lillypad, a few ultrasonic sensors and a vibration motor to help with object avoidence for the visually impaired. These modules are created and used as wearables.</p>
