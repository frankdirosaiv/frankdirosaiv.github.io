<p>This Immgo web application was built using python and the Django framework. This project allows you to drag-and-drop a picture of your dream destination into the website. Immgo will then determine the location of the image using the Google Vision API. The returned location of this API call is then sent several travel APIs to determine Flights, Hotels, and Car Rentals near your dream destination. </p>
