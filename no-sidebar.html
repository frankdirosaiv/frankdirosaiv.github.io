						<p>Howdy! My name is Frank DiRosa IV and I am a Computer Engineer at Texas A&M University. Growing up I had always been interested in math and physics hoping that one day I might be a great inventor like Elon Musk or Nicholas Tesla. But it wasn't until my senior year of high school that I was introduced to the basic hardware side of building a computer. After my first exposure with putting a basic PC, I fell in love with the field of computer engineering. Since then I've committed myself to learning as many aspects of circuitery and code as possible so that one day I might still be able to help invent that next big thing.</p>
